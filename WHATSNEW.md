### 2015.10.19, Version 0.9.0

This version brings significant changes and improvements.

1. Better way to customize individual plugins, for example: 

 - Basic image or video instead of branded embeds for Flickr or Imgur, or Instagram, or Tumblr
 - Different player UI for YouTube and Vimeo
 - "Classic" player for SoundCloud
 - Twitter: center or not, include media or not, show parent message, etc.
 - Facebook: for videos, show entire status rather then just a video
 - Show user message for Instagram embeds
 - Giphy: disable branded GIF player and use plain GIF instead
 - Turn on support of Twitter videos (experimental)

See sample config file for ways to customize. *Heads up:* `twitter.status` in config was renamed to just `twitter`. 


2. Caching improvements

 - We return the cache of source data such as meta and oEmbed or API calls. This way during the updates or whitelist changes Iframely won't create a tsunami of outbound traffic if there is a fresh copy of source in its cache. 
 - Twitter plugin has been completely re-written to properly address API calls caching and also nicely handle of errors 417 (i.e. Twitter's rate-limit reached)

3. Domains 

 - Number of improvements in existing domain plugins. Twitter Videos, better Imgur galleries, etc.
 - New domains: Wikipedia (proper thumbnail and meta), IGN, Dispatch, CBS News, Google Calendars.

4. Update dependencies. 

 - Please run `npm update` as package dependencies have changed. 
 - If you run into `../lib/kerberos.h:5:27: fatal error: gssapi/gssapi.h: No such file or directory`  - see [this comment](https://github.com/itteco/iframely/commit/991406b37da76f0a27501611702cb7a414136a6b)
